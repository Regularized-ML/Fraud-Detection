Detecting anomaly patterns in surveys using autoencoders

This was an internship assessment project that I was required to do, I have developed my skill using unsupervised learning with this project and had to expand my knowledge on autoencoders and how they work.

A breif report of the assessment is found in the file Report.pdf
